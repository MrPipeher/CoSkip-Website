                <h1 class="section-title">Terms of Service</h1>
                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 21, 2025</p>

                <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the co-skip.com website (the "Website") and the Co-Skip software (the "Software" or "Service") operated by Co-Skip ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

                <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

                <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>Co-Skip is a downloadable Windows application designed to act as an AI assistant. It allows users to utilize hotkeys to capture screen regions or input text, send this content to a third-party AI model for analysis, and receive responses displayed in an overlay interface. The Software requires specific system requirements as outlined on the Website (Windows Pro, Admin rights for installation).</p>

                <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
                <p>Upon successful purchase of a license key, Co-Skip grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Software strictly for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms and for the duration specified by your purchased license tier (e.g., 1 Day, 7 Day, 30 Day, 1 Year).</p>

                <h2>3. License Keys & Access</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Delivery:</strong> Your unique license key will be displayed on the confirmation page immediately following a successful payment via Stripe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for copying and securely storing your license key. Keys are essential for activating and using the Software.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Recovery:</strong> As outlined in our Privacy Policy, due to our commitment to anonymity, we do not store information linking purchases to individuals. Therefore, lost or stolen keys <strong>CANNOT</strong> be recovered or reissued by us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single User:</strong> Each license key is intended for use by a single individual user on their permitted device(s).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Payment and Refunds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Payments for license keys are processed through Stripe or other methods as explicitly offered (e.g., manual payments arranged via Discord). You agree to provide accurate payment information and authorize the transaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Prices for license keys are listed on the Website and are subject to change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Refunds are considered on a case-by-case basis and are only eligible if requested within <strong>24 hours</strong> of the initial purchase AND if a verifiable, reproducible technical issue prevents the core functionality of the Software (defined as hotkey-triggered text input and AI interaction via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>) on a system meeting the stated requirements, AND our support team (via Discord) is unable to resolve the issue after you provide necessary cooperation and information (e.g., screenshots, error details). Refunds are NOT provided if:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The key has been activated or used.</li>
                            <li>The issue relates to screenshot functionality (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>) being blocked by third-party software or system settings (as this is a known limitation and text input <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> remains the core fallback).</li>
                            <li>The request is made more than 24 hours after purchase.</li>
                            <li>You fail to meet the system requirements.</li>
                            <li>You violate these Terms of Service.</li>
                        </ul>
                        To request a refund under eligible conditions, contact support via our official <a href="https://discord.gg/vFdJmjjapa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> with proof of purchase and details of the technical issue.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. "Unlimited" Plans & Fair Use Policy</h2>
                <p>Our "30 Day Access" and "1 Year Access" plans are offered with the intention of providing generous access for individual users under the label "Unlimited Questions". However, to ensure service stability and prevent abuse, these plans are subject to a Fair Use Policy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soft Caps:</strong> The 30-Day plan includes up to <strong>1,000</strong> AI interactions (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>). The 1-Year plan includes up to <strong>5,000</strong> AI interactions per 30-day cycle within the year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These limits are significantly higher than typical individual usage and are primarily in place to detect and prevent abusive patterns such as key sharing, commercial resale/use, or automated bot-like activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reset for Legitimate Users:</strong> If a legitimate individual user approaches or hits these soft caps through normal, intended use, they can contact support via Discord. Upon verification that the usage pattern is not abusive (e.g., not indicative of sharing or commercial use), the interaction count can be reviewed and reset to ensure continued access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Abuse Determination:</strong> Co-Skip reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether usage constitutes abuse under this Fair Use Policy. Abusive usage may lead to suspension or termination of the license without refund.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>6. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You agree to use the Co-Skip Service only for lawful purposes and in accordanceance with these Terms. Critically, you accept sole responsibility for your actions while using the Software:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> You must comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical and Responsible Use:</strong> Co-Skip is intended as a tool for learning assistance, accessibility support, and other legitimate purposes. You are solely responsible for adhering to all academic integrity policies, institutional rules, examination regulations, platform terms of service (including those of testing platforms or applications you use it with), and ethical guidelines applicable to your situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prohibited Misuse:</strong> Any use of Co-Skip to engage in academic dishonesty, cheating, bypassing security measures in violation of terms you have agreed to, infringing on third-party rights, or facilitating any dishonest or unethical behavior is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of these Terms.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Requirements:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring your system meets the minimum requirements specified on the Website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Compatibility:</strong> While we aim for broad compatibility, we do not guarantee functionality with all third-party applications or environments. Users are encouraged to test compatibility, especially regarding hotkeys and screenshot functions, where possible and permitted.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Restrictions on Use</h2>
                <p>You agree not to, and not to permit others to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose, or otherwise commercially exploit the Service or make the Software available to any third party.</li>
                    <li>Share, distribute, or resell your license key. Sharing a key is a violation of these Terms.</li>
                    <li>Modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, decrypt, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Service.</li>
                    <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notice (including any notice of copyright or trademark) of Co-Skip or its affiliates, partners, suppliers, or the licensors of the Service.</li>
                    <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose, or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
                    <li>Use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Service or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Service.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users or third-party AI), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Co-Skip and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Co-Skip.</p>

                <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Use of the Service is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
                <p>Without limiting the foregoing, Co-Skip and its licensors do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable, or correct; that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.

                <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Co-Skip, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
                <p>In no event shall Co-Skip's aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Service exceed the amount paid by you to Co-Skip for the Service in the preceding 12 months.</p>

                <h2>11. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your license and access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms (such as misuse, key sharing, or violating responsible use policies).</p>
                <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately. If you wish to terminate your account (which, in practice, means ceasing to use your key), you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>

                <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in the jurisdiction where Co-Skip operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

                <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide notice (e.g., by posting on the Website) prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
