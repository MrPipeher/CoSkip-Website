                <h1 class="section-title">Terms of Service</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

                <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the co-skip.com website (the "Website") and the Co-Skip software (the "Software" or "Service") operated by Co-Skip ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

                <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

                <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>Co-Skip is a downloadable Windows application designed to act as an AI assistant. It allows users to capture screen regions or input text and send this content to a third-party AI model for analysis, with responses displayed in an overlay interface. The Service also includes an in-server economy and marketplace hosted on our official Discord server.</p>

                <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
                <p>Upon successful purchase, Co-Skip grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Software strictly for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms and for the duration specified by your purchased license tier.</p>
                
                <h2>3. License Keys & Access</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Delivery:</strong> Your unique license key is displayed on the confirmation page after payment and is also sent to the email you provide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for copying and securely storing your license key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single User Policy:</strong> Each license key is strictly for use by a single individual. Sharing, distributing, or reselling your key is a direct violation of these Terms, **except** as expressly permitted through the official Marketplace (see Section 7). We employ automated systems to detect suspicious usage patterns indicative of sharing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Payment and Refunds</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Payments for license keys are processed through Stripe or other offered manual methods. You agree to provide accurate payment information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> Refunds are considered on a case-by-case basis and are only eligible if requested within **24 hours** of purchase AND for a verifiable, reproducible technical issue preventing core functionality that our support team cannot resolve. Refunds are **NOT** provided if the key is activated/used, the issue relates to blocked screenshots (a known limitation), system requirements are not met, the request is made after 24 hours, or you violate these Terms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Plan Tiers and Usage Limits</h2>
                <p>Each license key corresponds to a specific plan tier with strictly defined usage limits (e.g., number of questions) for its duration. Unused questions do not roll over. The specific limits for each tier are detailed on the Website's pricing page.</p>
                <p><strong>Unlimited Plans Fair Use Policy:</strong> Our "Unlimited" plans are for heavy, legitimate individual use. They are not for automated, commercial, or shared use. We monitor for activity that compromises service stability (e.g., botting, scripting) and reserve the right to terminate licenses found in violation of this policy without refund.</p>
                
                <h2>6. In-Server Economy: Points, Lootboxes & Vouchers</h2>
                <p>Our official Discord server features a virtual economy. Your participation is subject to these terms.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Points:</strong> Points are a virtual currency with no direct cash value, earned from Lootboxes and redeemable for items in our Points Shop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lootboxes:</strong> A Lootbox is a digital good that grants a random virtual prize. You are always guaranteed to receive a prize. All Lootbox sales are final and non-refundable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vouchers:</strong> Vouchers are virtual "claim tickets" for a software key. They are the primary asset that can be traded on the P2P Marketplace.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>7. The P2P Marketplace (Consignment Agreement)</h2>
                <p>The Marketplace on our Discord server is the **ONLY** officially sanctioned method for transferring the value of a key.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consignment Agreement:</strong> When you list an active key for sale, you enter into a consignment agreement with Co-Skip. You agree to transfer ownership of your key to us for verification. We will disable your original key and list a "Voucher" of equivalent value (subject to our public Depreciation Policy) on your behalf.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Transaction:</strong> When another user buys your listing, they are purchasing a **brand new, equivalent key directly from Co-Skip.** The transaction is between the buyer and us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payout to Seller:</strong> After the sale is complete, we will pay you, the original owner, the final sale price minus our pre-disclosed **10% service fee**. This payout will be handled via a private ticket on Discord.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Co-Skip acts as the platform and escrow agent to ensure security. We are not responsible for user-defined prices or market fluctuations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You agree to use the Co-Skip Service only for lawful purposes. Critically, you accept sole responsibility for your actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Use:</strong> You are solely responsible for adhering to all academic integrity policies, institutional rules, examination regulations, and any other third-party terms of service applicable to your situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prohibited Misuse:</strong> Any use of Co-Skip to engage in cheating, academic dishonesty, or facilitating any unethical behavior is strictly prohibited.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Restrictions on Use</h2>
                <p>You agree not to (and not to permit others to) license, sell, rent, lease, assign, or distribute the Software or your license key outside of the official Marketplace. You also agree not to modify, reverse engineer, or otherwise tamper with the Software.</p>

                <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Co-Skip and its licensors.</p>

                <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                <p>The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind. Use of the Service is at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall Co-Skip be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages resulting from your use of the Service.</p>

                <h2>13. Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate your license and access to the Service immediately, without notice or refund, for any breach of these Terms, especially key sharing or prohibited misuse.</p>

                <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where Co-Skip operates.</p>

                <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of material changes. By continuing to use the Service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
